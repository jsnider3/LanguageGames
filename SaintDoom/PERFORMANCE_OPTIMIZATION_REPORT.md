# SaintDoom Performance Optimization Report

*Generated: August 13, 2025*

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the SaintDoom codebase, I've identified multiple performance bottlenecks that are likely causing frame drops, stuttering, and potential memory issues. The most critical problems involve excessive object creation in render loops, inefficient collision detection, and memory leaks in the visual effects system.

## Critical Performance Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Object Creation in Render Loops
**Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL**

#### Problem Areas:
- `effects/visualEffects.js:564-566` - Creating new ring geometries every frame for holy burst
- `modules/WeaponSystem.js:99-106` - New geometry/material for every holy water throw
- `modules/WeaponSystem.js:303-341` - Crucifix projectiles create meshes without pooling

#### Impact:
- Constant memory allocation causing GC pauses
- Frame drops when multiple effects active
- Memory usage grows unbounded

#### Solution:
```javascript
// Create a projectile pool at initialization
class ProjectilePool {
    constructor(size = 50) {
        this.pool = [];
        this.active = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            const projectile = this.createProjectile();
            projectile.visible = false;
            this.pool.push(projectile);
        }
    }
    
    get() {
        const projectile = this.pool.pop() || this.createProjectile();
        this.active.push(projectile);
        projectile.visible = true;
        return projectile;
    }
    
    release(projectile) {
        projectile.visible = false;
        const index = this.active.indexOf(projectile);
        if (index > -1) {
            this.active.splice(index, 1);
            this.pool.push(projectile);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Collision Detection O(n²) Complexity
**Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL**

#### Problem Areas:
- `modules/CollisionSystem.js:34-52` - Checking all entities against all others
- `modules/CollisionSystem.js:215-236` - Nested forEach loops for enemy-player collision

#### Impact:
- Performance degrades quadratically with enemy count
- 10 enemies = 100 checks, 20 enemies = 400 checks
- Major cause of combat slowdowns

#### Solution:
```javascript
// Implement spatial partitioning
class SpatialGrid {
    constructor(cellSize = 10) {
        this.cellSize = cellSize;
        this.grid = new Map();
    }
    
    hash(x, z) {
        const gridX = Math.floor(x / this.cellSize);
        const gridZ = Math.floor(z / this.cellSize);
        return `${gridX},${gridZ}`;
    }
    
    getNearby(position, radius) {
        const nearby = [];
        const cellRadius = Math.ceil(radius / this.cellSize);
        
        for (let dx = -cellRadius; dx <= cellRadius; dx++) {
            for (let dz = -cellRadius; dz <= cellRadius; dz++) {
                const key = this.hash(
                    position.x + dx * this.cellSize,
                    position.z + dz * this.cellSize
                );
                const cell = this.grid.get(key);
                if (cell) nearby.push(...cell);
            }
        }
        return nearby;
    }
}
```

### 3. Memory Leaks in Visual Effects
**Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL**

#### Problem Areas:
- `utils/VisualEffectsManager.js:24-42` - Particle explosions don't dispose geometry
- `utils/VisualEffectsManager.js:553-590` - Teleport effect creates 30+ meshes without cleanup
- `effects/visualEffects.js` - Multiple effects create materials without disposal

#### Impact:
- Memory usage grows continuously
- Eventually causes browser tab crash
- GPU memory exhaustion

#### Solution:
```javascript
// Always dispose of Three.js resources
function disposeEffect(effect) {
    if (effect.mesh) {
        effect.mesh.geometry?.dispose();
        effect.mesh.material?.dispose();
        if (Array.isArray(effect.mesh.material)) {
            effect.mesh.material.forEach(m => m.dispose());
        }
        scene.remove(effect.mesh);
    }
}

// Use a lifecycle manager
class EffectLifecycle {
    constructor(maxLifetime = 5000) {
        this.effects = new Set();
        this.maxLifetime = maxLifetime;
    }
    
    add(effect) {
        effect.createdAt = Date.now();
        this.effects.add(effect);
    }
    
    update() {
        const now = Date.now();
        for (const effect of this.effects) {
            if (now - effect.createdAt > this.maxLifetime) {
                disposeEffect(effect);
                this.effects.delete(effect);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## High Priority Optimizations

### 4. Physics System Optimization
**Severity: 🟠 HIGH**

#### Problems:
- `modules/PhysicsManager.js:115-133` - Scene traversal for floor detection every frame
- `modules/PhysicsManager.js:231-274` - All entities updated without distance culling

#### Solutions:
- Cache static geometry for floor detection
- Only update physics for entities within active radius
- Use fixed timestep for deterministic physics

### 5. Shadow Rendering Optimization
**Severity: 🟠 HIGH**

#### Problems:
- `modules/ShadowOptimizer.js:86-140` - All shadow casters active regardless of distance
- No shadow LOD system

#### Solutions:
- Disable shadows beyond certain distance
- Use lower resolution shadows for distant objects
- Limit to 3 shadow-casting lights maximum

### 6. Vector Math Optimization
**Severity: 🟠 HIGH**

#### Problems:
- Frequent `Math.sqrt()` calls in distance calculations
- Creating new Vector3 objects in loops

#### Solutions:
```javascript
// Use distance squared when possible
function isInRange(a, b, maxDist) {
    const dx = a.x - b.x;
    const dy = a.y - b.y;
    const dz = a.z - b.z;
    return (dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz) <= maxDist * maxDist;
}

// Reuse vector objects
const tempVec = new THREE.Vector3();
function updatePosition(object, target) {
    tempVec.subVectors(target, object.position);
    tempVec.normalize();
    object.position.addScaledVector(tempVec, speed * deltaTime);
}
```

## Medium Priority Optimizations

### 7. LOD System Improvements
- Pre-generate LOD geometries at load time
- Use imposters/billboards for very distant objects
- Implement hysteresis to prevent LOD thrashing

### 8. Batch Rendering
- Merge static geometry where possible
- Use instanced rendering for repeated objects (bullets, particles)
- Batch material changes

### 9. AI Optimization
- Implement behavior LOD (simpler AI for distant enemies)
- Stagger AI updates across frames
- Use predictive targeting instead of per-frame calculations

### 10. Audio Optimization
- Pool Web Audio oscillators
- Limit simultaneous sounds
- Use distance-based audio LOD

## Quick Wins (Easy Fixes)

1. **Add Early Returns**
   ```javascript
   // Before
   function update(entity) {
       // lots of calculations
   }
   
   // After
   function update(entity) {
       if (!entity.active) return;
       if (distanceToPlayer > MAX_UPDATE_DISTANCE) return;
       // calculations only for relevant entities
   }
   ```

2. **Cache Expensive Calculations**
   ```javascript
   // Cache player forward vector (changes rarely)
   let cachedForward = null;
   let lastYaw = null;
   
   function getPlayerForward() {
       if (lastYaw !== player.yaw) {
           lastYaw = player.yaw;
           cachedForward = new THREE.Vector3(
               -Math.sin(player.yaw),
               0,
               -Math.cos(player.yaw)
           );
       }
       return cachedForward;
   }
   ```

3. **Reduce Update Frequencies**
   ```javascript
   // Not everything needs 60fps updates
   let aiUpdateCounter = 0;
   function update() {
       // Physics at 60fps
       updatePhysics();
       
       // AI at 20fps
       if (aiUpdateCounter++ % 3 === 0) {
           updateAI();
       }
       
       // Particles at 30fps
       if (aiUpdateCounter % 2 === 0) {
           updateParticles();
       }
   }
   ```

## Performance Monitoring Implementation

Add this to track performance issues in real-time:

```javascript
class PerformanceMonitor {
    constructor() {
        this.metrics = {
            fps: 0,
            frameTime: 0,
            memoryUsed: 0,
            drawCalls: 0,
            triangles: 0
        };
        
        this.worstFrame = 0;
        this.frameCount = 0;
        this.lastTime = performance.now();
    }
    
    startFrame() {
        this.frameStart = performance.now();
    }
    
    endFrame(renderer) {
        const now = performance.now();
        const frameTime = now - this.frameStart;
        const deltaTime = now - this.lastTime;
        
        this.metrics.frameTime = frameTime;
        this.metrics.fps = 1000 / deltaTime;
        
        if (performance.memory) {
            this.metrics.memoryUsed = performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1048576;
        }
        
        const info = renderer.info;
        this.metrics.drawCalls = info.render.calls;
        this.metrics.triangles = info.render.triangles;
        
        if (frameTime > this.worstFrame) {
            this.worstFrame = frameTime;
            console.warn(`New worst frame: ${frameTime.toFixed(2)}ms`);
        }
        
        this.lastTime = now;
        this.frameCount++;
        
        // Log performance issues
        if (frameTime > 33) { // Below 30fps
            console.warn(`Slow frame: ${frameTime.toFixed(2)}ms`, this.metrics);
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The SaintDoom codebase has solid architecture but needs optimization in its implementation details. The most critical issues involve excessive object creation and inefficient algorithms that scale poorly. By implementing the suggested optimizations in priority order, you should see dramatic performance improvements, especially in combat-heavy scenes.

The estimated development time for all optimizations is 2-3 weeks, but implementing just the critical fixes (3-4 days) should provide immediate and noticeable improvements.

## Assistant Review and Additions

### What’s Already Strong
- Object pooling, spatial partitioning, and disposal discipline are correctly prioritized as the biggest wins.
- The roadmap balances “critical fixes now” with “structural improvements later.”
- The monitoring section is practical and can immediately surface regressions during development.

### Clarifications and Alignment With Current Code
- Existing systems: The game already has `PoolManager`, `LODManager`, `ShadowOptimizer`, `GeometryBatcher`, and `TimerManager` wired in `modules/Game.js`. Some effects and weapons partially use `poolManager` (e.g., holy effects in `WeaponSystem`). The report should note this and focus on increasing coverage and consistency, not re‑introducing new pools.
- Cleanup criteria: The level loader preserves camera-attached meshes flagged via `userData.isWeapon`. Ensure any new first‑person meshes (weapons/hands/effects) set this flag to avoid disappearing on transitions.
- HUD throttling: The HUD is already throttled (default 100ms). That’s good; keep a single throttled path for all DOM updates.

### Immediate Low-Risk Improvements (Quick Wins not listed)
1. Remove per-frame logging in tight loops
   - Multiple `console.log` calls exist inside render/update paths (e.g., `MeleeCombat.update`, `MeleeCombat.updateSwordPosition`, and debug logs in show/hide). Console I/O is surprisingly expensive and can tank FPS. Gate logs behind a global `debugMode` and avoid logs inside `update()`.
   ```javascript
   if (game.debugMode) logger.debug('...'); // Never log every frame
   ```

2. Mark FPS meshes for culling behavior
   - First‑person models attached to the camera (sword, hands, weapons) should set `frustumCulled = false` and an explicit `renderOrder` to avoid extra culling checks and sorting overhead.
   ```javascript
   swordMesh.frustumCulled = false;
   swordMesh.renderOrder = 10; // render after world
   ```

3. Freeze static transforms
   - For walls/altars/pillars created in levels, set `matrixAutoUpdate = false` and call `updateMatrix()` once to skip per‑frame matrix recomputation.
   ```javascript
   wall.matrixAutoUpdate = false;
   wall.updateMatrix();
   ```

4. Prefer `MeshBasicMaterial` for FX when lighting isn’t needed
   - Many transient VFX use `MeshStandardMaterial`. Switching to `MeshBasicMaterial` reduces shader cost and avoids unnecessary lighting passes.

5. Avoid creating closures in hot loops
   - Inline `() => {}` callbacks within `update()` (e.g., animation effects) allocate each frame. Lift them once or use named functions stored on the instance.

### Object Pooling and Geometry/Material Reuse
- Expand pool usage: Standardize effect/projectile creation through `PoolManager` to avoid ad‑hoc new Mesh/Material creation. Add coverage for:
  - Crucifix projectiles and impacts
  - Muzzle flashes and sword trails
  - Debris and small ambient particles
- Centralize geometry/material caches:
  - Introduce a `GeometryCache`/`MaterialCache` for frequently reused primitives (boxes, cones, cylinders, quads) and common materials (holy glow, smoke, fire). This avoids re‑allocating identical resources.

### Spatial Partitioning Details
- Grid vs. BVH: Start with a simple uniform grid for collision broad‑phase. Consider switching enemies and projectiles to the same grid so both queries benefit.
- Update cadence: Rebuild grid per frame for dynamic actors only; static level colliders don’t need to move between cells.

### Physics and AI Budgeting
- Fixed timestep: Use a semi‑fixed physics timestep (e.g., 60Hz accumulator) to stabilize behavior under load and reduce jitter.
- Behavior LOD: Distant enemies update AI less frequently and use simplified steering/aim. Near enemies use full logic.
- Staggering: Spread AI updates across frames deterministically to avoid bursty spikes.

### Shadow and Lighting Strategy
- Dynamic shadow distance: `ShadowOptimizer.adjustShadowDistance` already adapts. Add hysteresis and clamp ranges to prevent oscillation.
- Limit casters: Only hero objects and large silhouettes cast shadows. Mark small props as `castShadow = false`.
- Choose cheaper shadow types: For low‑end devices, allow falling back to `THREE.BasicShadowMap` in a “Performance” preset.

### Renderer & Resolution Scaling
- Dynamic resolution: Adjust `renderer.setPixelRatio` at runtime based on moving FPS average.
  ```javascript
  const target = 60;
  if (fps < target - 10) pixelRatio = Math.max(1.0, pixelRatio - 0.25);
  if (fps > target + 10) pixelRatio = Math.min(2.0, pixelRatio + 0.25);
  renderer.setPixelRatio(pixelRatio);
  ```
- Optional: dynamic FOV narrowing during heavy load reduces overdraw (small effect but free).

### Particle Systems
- Prefer `InstancedMesh` or `Points` with a single material over many Meshes. Update attributes in a single buffer per frame.
- Pool particle systems and reuse buffers; avoid creating new BufferGeometries for each burst.

### Audio System Notes
- Pool nodes: Create a small pool of `GainNode`/`OscillatorNode` objects; reuse rather than construct/destroy per sound.
- Distance culling: Skip creating sounds for events beyond the audible radius.
- Envelope reuse: Precompute curves where possible.

### Performance Monitoring Additions
- GPU timings: Use `EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2` when available to measure GPU frame time separate from CPU.
- Per‑subsystem budget: Track CPU time by bucket (AI, Physics, Weapons, Rendering prep). A simple high‑level timer around each update block is enough to surface top offenders quickly.
- Automatic breadcrumbing: When a frame exceeds a threshold, capture last N spikes with their subsystem timings to accelerate diagnosis.

### Risk/Trade‑offs and Guardrails
- Pool overgrowth: Ensure pools cap their size and shrink during lulls; otherwise pools can grow and never release.
- Memory disposal: For any one‑off effect still using new materials, guarantee a disposal path in its lifecycle.
- Quality presets: Provide “Low/Medium/High” performance modes that map to shadow quality, resolution scale, particle count, and AI tick rate. Expose a toggle in Options.

### Suggested Near‑Term Additions (1–2 days)
1. Remove per‑frame console logs; guard remaining logs.
2. Set `frustumCulled=false` and `renderOrder` for FPS weapon meshes.
3. Freeze static geometry transforms in level constructors.
4. Switch transient VFX to `MeshBasicMaterial` where possible.
5. Add dynamic resolution scaling based on moving FPS average.

### Validation Scenarios to Add
- “No‑AI” render test: Disable AI entirely and measure gains to separate CPU gameplay cost from GPU cost.
- “Shadows off” test: Toggle shadows off at runtime; if FPS jumps significantly, focus on casters and distance.
- Particle storm: Spawn a fixed number of particle systems and validate the instance‑based path stays flat in CPU time.

### Final Note
Most structural pieces already exist in the codebase (pooling, LOD, shadow optimization). The primary lift is making usage consistent and removing hotspots caused by logging, unnecessary allocations, and heavy materials in FX. Implement the near‑term additions first; they’re safe, quick, and will immediately smooth frame pacing.

## Implementation Progress (Aug 13, 2025)

This section tracks what has actually been implemented in code so far, mapped to the Critical and Quick Win recommendations.

### Completed (Critical)
- Spatial partitioning for collisions:
  - Added lightweight `SpatialGrid` and integrated into `CollisionSystem` to reduce enemy checks to nearby candidates.
  - Rebuilt each frame from `Game.updateCollisions()`.
  - Files: `modules/CollisionSystem.js`, `modules/Game.js`.
- Holy Water grenade pooling:
  - New `GrenadePool` (via `PoolManager`) to reuse grenade meshes and avoid allocations per throw.
  - `HolyWaterWeapon` now spawns from pool and releases after explosion.
  - Files: `modules/ObjectPool.js`, `modules/WeaponSystem.js`.
- Muzzle flash allocation removal:
  - `RangedCombat.createMuzzleFlash()` uses pooled particles instead of allocating new meshes/materials; fallback provided.
  - File: `modules/WeaponSystem.js`.
- Disposal discipline for VFX:
  - Holy ring and per-particle materials now disposed on completion to prevent leaks.
  - File: `modules/Utils.js`.

### Completed (Quick Wins)
- Gated per-frame logs behind `debugMode`; removed hot-path spam in weapons and game loop.
  - Files: `modules/WeaponSystem.js`, `modules/Game.js`.
- FPS weapon meshes configured to skip frustum culling and render after world (`renderOrder = 10`).
  - File: `modules/WeaponSystem.js`.
- Static level geometry (created via `createWall`) freezes transforms (`matrixAutoUpdate=false; updateMatrix()`).
  - File: `levels/baseLevel.js`.
- Weapon persistence across level transitions (flagging meshes with `userData.isWeapon`).
  - File: `modules/WeaponSystem.js`.

### In Progress / Next Targets
- Pool crucifix projectiles and impact effects (similar to grenades).
- Extend spatial grid queries to projectile vs. enemy broad-phase if needed.
- Replace any remaining transient VFX that use `MeshStandardMaterial` with `MeshBasicMaterial` where lighting isn’t required.
- Continue removing per-frame allocations/closures in hot loops (effects/animations).

### Validation Checklist (to run during playtesting)
- Grenade spam: Throw 10+ holy water grenades in quick succession; watch for stable FPS and memory (DevTools heap should remain flat over time).
- Shotgun burst: Fire repeatedly; ensure no new Meshes accumulate in the scene and no GC spikes.
- Collision density: Spawn 20+ enemies and confirm movement/collision remains smooth (grid reduces checks).
- Long session: 20–30 minutes of play; verify memory does not steadily climb (VFX disposal working).

### Rollback and Safety
- All pooling changes have fallbacks: if a pool is missing, code paths create meshes and dispose them explicitly to avoid leaks.
- Changes are localized and guarded; behavior is preserved while removing allocations.
