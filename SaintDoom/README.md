# SaintDoom: Unholy Retribution

A browser-based FPS game where you play as Saint Giovanni, resurrected by the Vatican to stop a demonic invasion.

## How to Run

The game is currently in a single HTML file (`saintdoom.html`) for easy local testing without CORS issues.

### Option 1: Simple Python Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/saintdoom.html

### Option 2: Node.js Server
```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run server
http-server -p 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/saintdoom.html

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
If using VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension and right-click on `saintdoom.html` â†’ "Open with Live Server"

## Module Structure (For Future Refactoring)

The game has been designed with modularity in mind. The existing module files are:
- `player.js` - Player controller
- `enemy.js` - Enemy AI and types
- `combat.js` - Weapon systems
- `level.js` - Level generation
- `collision.js` - Collision detection
- `input.js` - Input management
- `game.js` - Main game loop

To convert to modules, run a local web server and update the HTML to use `type="module"` scripts.
