# SaintDoom: Unholy Retribution - Story & Lore Document

## Main Narrative Arc

### Premise
In the year 2025, a top-secret Men In Black facility hidden beneath the Utah desert has been conducting experiments on recovered alien technology. Unknown to them, the alien artifacts were not merely extraterrestrial - they were interdimensional conduits with connections to the infernal realms. When an experiment to weaponize alien energy sources goes catastrophically wrong, a portal to Hell is torn open, and demonic forces flood the facility.

The Vatican's secret military arm, the modern Inquisition, has been monitoring the situation. Knowing that conventional weapons and even their current holy warriors cannot stem this tide, they initiate Protocol Lazarus - the resurrection of Saint Giovanni di Ferrara, a legendary 13th-century crusader who died defending pilgrims in the Holy Land.

### The Protagonist

**Saint Giovanni di Ferrara** (1215-1248, and beyond)
- Born in Ferrara, Northern Italy, to a noble family
- Took the cross at age 20, joining the Seventh Crusade
- Known for single-handedly holding a bridge against 50 attackers while pilgrims escaped
- Died after being struck by 13 arrows, continuing to fight until the last pilgrim was safe
- Canonized in 1289 for his miraculous defense and reported healings at his tomb
- His incorruptible body was secretly preserved by the Vatican

**The Vatican's Secret Weapon** (1289-Present)
- First resurrected in 1347 during the Black Death to fight demon-possessed plague carriers
- Awakened in 1571 before the Battle of Lepanto to eliminate Ottoman demon-summoners
- Called upon in 1798 to retrieve holy artifacts from Napoleon's occult advisors
- Deployed to the trenches of WWI (1917) to stop the German "Hexenkrieg" program
- Last awakened in 1943 to sabotage Nazi occult experiments at Castle Wewelsburg
- Each resurrection leaves him more distant from humanity but more skilled in combat
- Has learned to use firearms, explosives, and modern tactics over centuries
- Still prefers his blessed sword - the one constant across all his resurrections

### The Awakening (Tutorial Narrative)

You awaken in Sublevel 7 of the Vatican Black Site, deep beneath St. Peter's Basilica. The familiar cold of resurrection fills your bones - this is the seventh time you've been torn from eternal rest. Your memories cascade: Jerusalem 1248, your first death. The Black Death. Lepanto. The Somme. Wewelsburg Castle. Each awakening blurs into the next.

Cardinal Torretti stands before you - different face, same role. They always send a Cardinal. "Saint Giovanni, forgive us for disturbing your rest once more. It has been 82 years since Wewelsburg. The threat this time... it may be the worst yet."

The Inquisition's scientists run you through the familiar protocols - motor functions, weapons check, blessing calibration. Your armor awaits, modernized but recognizable. Your sword, blessed and re-blessed across centuries, still perfectly balanced in your hand. They offer you the usual selection of modern weapons. You take a shotgun (useful in trenches, useful here) and a pistol (learned that lesson in 1943). But your hand always returns to the sword's grip - muscle memory from your first life, the only life that truly felt like yours.

"The Americans opened a portal to Hell," Torretti explains. "Men In Black facility, Utah. They didn't listen to our warnings. They never do."

You nod. It's always the same - someone plays with forces beyond their comprehension, and you're awakened to clean up the mess. As you complete your equipment check, you're loaded into something new - a Sanctified Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. "Times change," Torretti shrugs. "But the mission remains."

Your impact creates a crater in the facility's chapel, your entry point into this modern hellscape.

## Level Narratives

### Prologue: Resurrection Protocol
The Vatican Black Site has been preparing for this day. Ancient prophecies spoke of a time when "the star-touched would open the gate, and only the sanctified dead could close it." Your resurrection chamber is adorned with frescoes depicting your mortal deeds, a reminder of who you were - and what you must become.

### Chapter 1: Holy Arrival

**The Desecrated Chapel**
Your missile impact destroys the facility's non-denominational chapel, a symbolic beginning. The altar has been defiled with alien symbols that now glow with hellfire. Dead MIB agents rise as zombies, their last transmission: "The stars were wrong. God help us, the stars were wrong."

**Research Labs**
Dr. Elizabeth Chen's audio logs reveal the truth: "The artifact responded to our energy input by... singing. It was beautiful until we realized it was a summoning hymn. The harmonics opened something. Jenkins was the first to change, his eyes went black and he started speaking in tongues - not any alien language, but something older."

### Chapter 2: Into the Depths

**The Armory**
MIB Agent Johnson's final stand. His graffiti on the wall: "They came through the floors. Bullets don't work. Morrison tried the holy water from the chapel as a joke - it worked. God forgive us for what we've unleashed."

**Containment Breach**
The alien specimens have been possessed. Grey Ambassador Zx'theta's message scrawled in its own blood: "We tried to warn you. The Fallen Ones seek return. Only the Crowned Shepherds can stop them. Find the Twelve Seals."

### Chapter 3: Underground Nightmare

**Secret Tunnels**
These passages predate the MIB facility - Spanish conquistador markings reveal they found something here in 1540 and sealed it. The MIB broke those seals. Ghostly conquistadors occasionally appear, pointing the way forward, their leader whispering "San Giovanni, finish what we could not."

**The Hive**
The Greys were breeding here, trying to create bodies pure enough to house angelic spirits and fight the demons. All failed. The possessed hybrids now use the birthing chambers to spawn more abominations.

### Chapter 4: Ascension

**The Observatory**
The facility was receiving signals from space - not from aliens, but from the Heavenly Host, warning of the approaching convergence. The last decoded message: "The Seraphim weep. The Watchers have failed. Send your strongest soul."

**Communications Array**
Someone has been broadcasting a repeating message to the Vatican: "Protocol Lazarus authorized. Saint Giovanni rises. The Inquisition remembers. Deus Vult."

### Chapter 5: Final Confrontation

**Nuclear Reactor**
The demons plan to cause a meltdown, creating a permanent hellmouth. The reactor's blessed uranium core (the Vatican's secret contribution to the facility) is the only thing slowing them down.

**The Portal Chamber**
Belial awaits, the artifact Zero floating above him. He speaks: "Giovanni of Ferrara. I watched you die in Jerusalem. Such delicious pride in your martyrdom. Now you are an abomination like us - neither living nor dead. Join me, crusader. Heaven has abandoned you to fight their wars."

## Environmental Storytelling Elements

### Visual Narratives
- Bullet holes that form cross patterns (agents' last desperate attempts at holy symbols)
- Alien writing that morphs into Latin prayers when viewed through holy water
- MIB agent bodies positioned in prayer positions
- Grey corpses arranged in angelic wing patterns
- Scorch marks on walls that look like angel wings
- Blood messages switching between English, Alien, and Latin

### The Secret Truth
Hidden throughout the game is the ultimate revelation: The alien Greys are the descendants of the Nephilim, trying to earn redemption by warning humanity about demonic threats. The Vatican has always known this. The MIB's refusal to acknowledge the supernatural doomed them. You, Saint Giovanni, are humanity's last hope - a divine paradox, a holy undead, the only being that can walk between worlds and seal the breach.
