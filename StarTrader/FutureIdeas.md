# Star Trader - Future Ideas

This document outlines potential features and expansions to transform Star Trader from a simple trading game into a vast, dynamic, and immersive space simulation.

## I. Deeper Economic Simulation

*   **Dynamic Supply and Demand:** Instead of static prices, markets would fluctuate based on player actions, faction wars, and galactic events. A player flooding a market with a specific good would see its price crash.
*   **Resource Supply Chains:** Introduce multi-stage production. A system might mine raw ore, which is then shipped to an industrial system to be refined into metals, which are then used in a high-tech system to build ship components. Players could profit by controlling key links in these chains.
*   **Stock Market:** Allow players to invest in galactic corporations or even individual star systems. Dividends could provide passive income, but market crashes could be devastating.
*   **Illegal Goods & Black Markets:** **(Implemented)** The game now includes illegal goods that can be bought and sold on black markets in certain systems. This adds a high-risk, high-reward gameplay loop, with customs scans and reputation penalties as potential consequences.

## II. Expanded Universe & Exploration

*   **Factions & Reputation:** **(Partially Implemented)** The galaxy is now populated by distinct factions. Player reputation is tracked and trading with a faction increases standing. High reputation provides discounts on fuel and repairs.
    *   **Next Steps:** Implement negative consequences for low reputation. Add more ways to gain/lose rep (missions, combat).
*   **Procedurally Generated Galaxy:** While key "core" systems would be hand-crafted, the vast majority of the galaxy could be procedurally generated, offering endless exploration.
*   **Anomalies & Discoveries:** Exploration wouldn't just be about finding new systems. Players could discover wormholes, ancient ruins, derelict "ghost ships," or unique stellar phenomena (e.g., nebulae that interfere with sensors, black holes). These discoveries could trigger unique quests or offer valuable salvage.
*   **Starport Services:**
    *   **News Terminal:** Add a "news" or "bulletin board" service at starports. This would be the primary way for players to learn about galactic events, trade opportunities (e.g., famines, strikes), and find missions.
    *   **Mission Board:** A dedicated place to find and accept generated quests.

## III. Richer Gameplay & Player Agency

*   **Player Skills:** Introduce a simple skill system for the player character. Skills like `Piloting`, `Mechanics`, and `Negotiation` could provide passive bonuses to evasion, repair efficiency, and trade prices.
*   **Crew Management:** Instead of just a ship, players would manage a crew.
    *   Hire crew members with unique skills (e.g., a hot-shot pilot for better evasion, a shrewd negotiator for better trade prices, a veteran marine for better combat).
    *   Crew members would have morale, gain experience, and could even have their own personal side-quests.
*   **Deeper Ship Customization:** **(Implemented)** The ship is now fully modular. Players can buy and install different components (weapons, shields, engines, etc.) into a limited number of slots on their ship's hull. This allows for specialized ship builds.
    *   **Next Steps:** Add a `sell <module_id>` command to the shipyard to allow players to sell their old modules. Introduce more ship classes with different slot layouts.
*   **Missions & Storylines:** **(Partially Implemented)** The game now has a mission board with procedurally generated "delivery" and "procurement" missions. Missions have time limits and failure conditions.
    *   **Next Steps:** Add more mission types (bounty hunting, exploration).
*   **Player-Owned Structures:** Allow high-level players to build their own space stations or establish colonies on planets, creating their own nodes in the galactic economy.

## IV. More Dynamic Events

*   **Galactic Events:** Large-scale events that affect the entire galaxy, such as a new technology being discovered (disrupting markets), a faction war breaking out (creating blockades and new mission opportunities), or a pirate fleet beginning a major raiding campaign.
*   **Personal Events:** Events tied directly to the player's story. An old rival from their past could appear, or a crew member might reveal a hidden agenda.
