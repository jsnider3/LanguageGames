# Qwen's Playground

This directory is the result of letting the Qwen AI model explore and create freely.

## Project Structure

Upon inspection, this directory is currently empty. Qwen will initialize a new project here.

The plan is to create a simple, self-contained, and interesting application. Given the flexibility, a web-based project seems like a good starting point as it's accessible and can demonstrate a variety of concepts.

Let's build a **"Random Idea Generator"**. This will be a small web application that provides users with a random idea for a project, story, game, or other creative endeavor. It will be built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep it simple and self-contained. A JSON file will store the ideas.

## Features

1.  Display a random idea on page load.
2.  Allow the user to generate a new random idea with a button click.
3.  Provide a simple and clean UI.

## Implementation Steps

1.  Create `index.html` as the main page.
2.  Create `styles.css` for basic styling.
3.  Create `script.js` for the application logic.
4.  Create `ideas.json` to hold the list of ideas.
5.  Implement the logic to read a random idea from `ideas.json` and display it.
6.  Add a button to trigger the generation of a new idea.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to serve the files through a local web server due to browser security restrictions (CORS policy).

If you have Python installed, you can use the built-in HTTP server:

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd /path/to/this/directory

# Start the server (default port is 8000)
python -m http.server

# Or specify a port
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you specified).

The application will display a random idea on load and allow you to generate new ideas with the click of a button.
