# VectorDodger Improvements Roadmap

## Overview
VectorDodger is a minimalist bullet hell game with solid fundamentals. This document outlines improvements that would transform it from a simple dodge-only game into a full-featured arcade experience with progression, strategy, and replayability.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Progressive Weapon System (Priority: HIGH)
Transform the player from purely defensive to having offensive capabilities that unlock over time.

#### Implementation Details:
- **Survival-Based Unlocks**: Players gain weapon capabilities at specific survival milestones (30s, 60s, 120s, etc.)
- **Weapon Types**:
  - **Basic Shot** (30s): Single projectile forward firing
  - **Spread Shot** (60s): 3-way shot in a cone pattern
  - **Laser Beam** (120s): Continuous beam weapon with limited duration
  - **Homing Missiles** (180s): Slow but tracking projectiles
  - **Orbital Shield** (240s): Rotating defensive projectiles
  - **Screen Clear Bomb** (300s): Emergency one-time use ability

#### Technical Approach:
- Add player projectile system with collision detection against enemies
- Implement weapon switching UI (number keys or automatic progression)
- Create visual feedback for weapon unlocks
- Balance damage values and fire rates for each weapon type

### 2. Boss Battle System (Priority: HIGH)
Introduce multi-phase boss encounters that serve as skill checks and memorable moments.

#### Boss Design:
- **Mini-Boss** (every 2 minutes): Smaller boss with 2 attack patterns
- **Major Boss** (every 5 minutes): Screen-filling boss with 3-4 phases
- **Final Boss** (10 minutes): Ultimate challenge with adaptive AI

#### Attack Pattern Examples:
- **Spiral Barrage**: Rotating spiral of projectiles
- **Laser Grid**: Crossing laser beams that sweep the screen
- **Bullet Rain**: Top-down projectile curtain with safe spots
- **Radial Burst**: Expanding rings of projectiles from center
- **Homing Swarm**: Slow homing projectiles in large numbers

#### Technical Requirements:
- Boss health bar UI element
- Phase transition animations
- Pattern scripting system
- Boss-specific visual effects

### 3. Power-Up System Enhancement (Priority: MEDIUM)
Expand the current power-up system with more variety and strategic choices.

#### New Power-Ups:
- **Rapid Fire**: Increases fire rate for 10 seconds
- **Damage Boost**: Double damage for 15 seconds
- **Time Slow**: Slows all enemies/projectiles by 50% for 5 seconds
- **Magnet**: Attracts all power-ups on screen
- **Shield**: Absorbs next 3 hits
- **Score Multiplier**: 2x score for 20 seconds

#### Power-Up Chaining:
- Collecting same type extends duration
- Collecting different types can create combo effects
- Visual indicators for active power-ups

### 4. Enemy Variety and Behaviors (Priority: MEDIUM)
Add diverse enemy types with unique movement patterns and attacks.

#### New Enemy Types:
- **Sniper**: Stationary, fires aimed shots at player
- **Bomber**: Drops area-effect explosions
- **Shielder**: Blocks player shots, requires flanking
- **Splitter**: Divides into smaller enemies when destroyed
- **Teleporter**: Warps around screen, surprise attacks
- **Kamikaze**: Accelerates toward player position

#### Enemy Formations:
- Wave patterns (V-formation, circles, lines)
- Coordinated attacks between enemy types
- Difficulty scaling with enemy combinations

### 5. Environmental Hazards (Priority: MEDIUM)
Add dynamic level elements that affect gameplay tactics.

#### Hazard Types:
- **Moving Walls**: Block movement and projectiles
- **Gravity Wells**: Pull player and projectiles
- **Electric Fields**: Damage over time zones
- **Rotating Barriers**: Require timing to navigate
- **Destructible Cover**: Temporary protection

### 6. Progression and Persistence (Priority: LOW)
Add meta-progression to encourage repeated plays.

#### Features:
- **High Score Leaderboard**: Track best runs
- **Achievement System**: Unlock cosmetic rewards
- **Ship Customization**: Different player sprites/colors
- **Statistics Tracking**: Total enemies destroyed, time survived
- **Daily Challenges**: Special rule modifiers

### 7. Visual and Audio Polish (Priority: LOW)
Enhance the game feel with improved feedback systems.

#### Visual Improvements:
- Particle effects for explosions
- Screen shake for impacts
- Weapon charging animations
- Background parallax scrolling
- Color-coded threat indicators

#### Audio Additions:
- Weapon sound effects
- Enemy destruction sounds
- Boss music themes
- Power-up collection chimes
- Warning sounds for threats

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay Enhancement
1. Progressive Weapon System
2. Basic enemy variety (3-4 new types)
3. Enhanced power-up system

### Phase 2: Major Features
1. Boss Battle System
2. Advanced enemy behaviors
3. Environmental hazards

### Phase 3: Polish and Persistence
1. Visual and audio improvements
2. Progression system
3. Achievement system

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization:
- Object pooling for projectiles
- Efficient collision detection (spatial partitioning)
- Canvas rendering optimizations

### Code Architecture:
- Weapon system as modular components
- Enemy behavior state machines
- Event system for achievements/unlocks
- Separate rendering from game logic

### Browser Compatibility:
- Test on mobile devices (touch controls)
- Ensure 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- Progressive enhancement for effects

## Success Metrics
- Average survival time increases from ~1 minute to 3-5 minutes
- Player retention for multiple sessions
- Clear skill progression curve
- Memorable moments (boss defeats, close calls)

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic player shooting mechanics
2. Add first weapon type (basic shot)
3. Create weapon unlock system based on survival time
4. Test and balance weapon effectiveness
5. Iterate based on playtesting feedback
