# Project: The Crimson Case

## Project Goal
To create an interactive text-based detective game where the player solves a murder mystery. The game should be engaging, intellectually stimulating, and driven by player choices.

## Core Concepts
*   **Narrative-Driven:** The game is a story that unfolds based on player commands.
*   **Choice Matters:** Player decisions will affect the outcome of the investigation.
*   **Evidence Collection:** Players will need to find clues, interrogate suspects, and piece together the story.
*   **Simple Command Interface:** Players interact using simple commands like `look`, `talk to [character]`, `examine [object]`, `go to [location]`.

## Development Plan
1.  **Setup:**
    *   Create a main Python file (e.g., `game.py`).
    *   Establish the basic game loop (read player input, process command, print output).
2.  **Story Outline:**
    *   Develop the core plot: the victim, the suspects, the motive, and the key clues.
    *   Map out the locations the player can visit.
3.  **Game World Implementation:**
    *   Create data structures (e.g., dictionaries or classes) to represent locations, characters, and items.
    *   Each location should have a description and a list of items or characters present.
4.  **Command Parsing:**
    *   Implement a function to parse player input into commands and arguments (e.g., "talk to" and "butler").
5.  **Game Logic:**
    *   Implement the logic for each command (`look`, `talk`, `examine`, etc.).
    *   Create a system to track game state (e.g., clues found, conversations had).
6.  **Winning/Losing:**
    *   Define the conditions for solving the mystery (e.g., accusing the correct suspect with the right evidence).
    *   Create an ending sequence.

## Tone and Style
*   The writing should be evocative and mysterious, in the style of classic detective fiction.
*   Descriptions should be detailed enough to paint a picture but leave room for imagination.

## Technical Stack
*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Dependencies:** No external libraries are necessary for the initial version. The standard library is sufficient.
